Total Lines of Code (LOC): 486
Files Analyzed: 1 (c4.c)
2. Function Analysis:

Number of Functions: 4
Functions with Details:
next: LOC = 84, Cyclomatic Complexity (CCN) = 85, Tokens = 1016, Parameters = 0
expr: LOC = 147, CCN = 91, Tokens = 2403, Parameters = 1
stmt: LOC = 47, CCN = 15, Tokens = 395, Parameters = 0
main: LOC = 181, CCN = 100, Tokens = 2214, Parameters = 2
3. Complexity and Risks:

Average LOC per Function: 114.8
Average Cyclomatic Complexity per Function: 72.8
Average Tokens per Function: 1507.0
Functions with High Risk (CCN > 15 or LOC > 100): next, expr, main
4. Loop and Control Structure Analysis:

'if|while|for' Keywords Appear: 217 times
5. Memory Usage:

Heap Usage at Program Exit: 0 bytes (no memory leaks)
Total Heap Transactions: 1 allocation, 1 free, 1024 bytes allocated
6. Recommendations:

Consider refactoring functions next, expr, and main to reduce complexity and improve maintainability.
Monitor and optimize memory usage, especially in dynamic allocation patterns, to avoid potential leaks in larger or more complex scenarios.
